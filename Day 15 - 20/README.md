# FUNCTIONS

Functions are one of the most fundamental concepts in JS. <br/>
**A function is a piece of code that we can re-use in our code. With functions, we can create reuseable chunks of code. It can contain one or more lines of code.** <br/>

- Using the function at any point in the code is called invoking/running/calling the function. <br/>
A function can also return data. <br/>

**The parameters represent the input data of the function. Parameters are variables that are specific only to a function and they would get defined once we run the function. A parameter is just like a local variable that is only available inside of a function.** <br/>

- **The actual values of the parameters are called the arguments.** <br/>

- *Simple functions would not have to return anything or accept any parameters.* <br/>
