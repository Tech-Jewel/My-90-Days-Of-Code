Value is the smallest unit of information that we have in JS.
We can store our values in variables so we can use them over and over again.

We can declare variables with JavaScript using the "**let**" , "**var**"  or "**const**" keywords.
We use the "let" keyoword to declare values that can be changed later.
We can reassign or mutate variables(change its values).
Do NOT use "var" keywords to declare variables for now.

We use the "const" keyword to declare values that canhave constant values throughout the code. It cannot be mutated.
We cannot declare empty const variables.
**Let is blocks code and var is functions code.**
For now, never use "var".
It is a good practice to have as little variable changes as possible because change in variable could cause errors in code.
Better to use "const"
Examples:
`let name = "Jewel";`
`var age = 20;`
`const pi = 3.14;`
